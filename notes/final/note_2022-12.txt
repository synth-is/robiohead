The sample based virtual instrument .wav files are not included with this repository but can either be rendered with the synth.is project or (temporarily) downloaded from here:
https://uio-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/bthj_uio_no/Eatj-3njkwtCmArnSOZbAO8BgS3nieMdT2NydyTSM-o89Q?e=IefYdw
The `samplepackx` folders, where X is the number of the sample pack, are placed in the `Pd` folder.

The genes behind those rendered sounds can be found in the `genes` folder.

External Pure data dependencies include:
sfalib (made by Stefano Fasciani) and Maxlib:
